# Introduction #
This projects has the implementation of the algorithm described by Overmars and Van Leeuwen<sup>1</sup> to maintain the convex hull of a dynamic set.  I did this implementation and fully described it in my MSc Dissertation at the University of Edinburgh ["Maintenance of the Convex Hull of a Dynamic Set"](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM070449.pdf).
